        </header>

        <p>
          <em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> is a stylesheet language used to
          describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
          (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
          how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on
          other media.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is among the core languages of the <em>open web</em> and is
          standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications.
          Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done
          synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations.
          You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never
          become an official version.
        </p>
        <p>
          From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and
          the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that
          it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
          separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification,
          W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of
          the CSS specification.

        <h3>CSS Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          If you're new to web development, be sure to read our CSS basics
          article to learn what CSS is and how to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
          language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to
          selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
          paragraph text, setting the color to red:
        </p>
        <code>
          p { <br />
          color: red; <br />
          }
        </code>
        <h3>CSS Tutorials</h3>
        <p>
          Our CSS learning area contains a wealth of tutorials to take you from
          beginner level to proficiency, covering all the fundamentals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our exhaustive CSS reference for seasoned Web developers describes
          every property and concept of CSS.

        <h4>Basic Rule Syntax</h4>
        <code>
          style-rule ::= <br />

          }
        </code>
        <p>where:</p>
        <code>
          selectors-list ::= <br />
          selector[:pseudo-class] [::pseudo-element] <br />
          [, selectors-list] <br />

        <p>
          Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS from
          the ground up — no previous knowledge required.
        </p>
        <a href="#">CSS first steps</a>
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages —
          for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
          content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
          decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your
          path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
          syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
          HTML.
        </p>
        <a href="#">CSS building blocks</a>
        <p>
          This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've
          gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some
          basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This
          module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we
          have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders,
          debugging, and lots more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent
          CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on
          to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.
        </p>
        <a href="#">Styling text</a>
        <p>
          With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for
          you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things
          you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
          including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing,
          drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by
          looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and
          links.
        </p>
        <a href="#">CSS layout</a>
        <p>
          At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style
          text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits
          inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right
          place in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered
          the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout,
          looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like
          flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques
          you might still want to know about.
        </p>
        <a href="#">Use CSS to solve common problems</a>
        <p>
          This module provides links to sections of content explaining how to
          use CSS to solve common problems when creating a web page.

          The CSS layout cookbook aims to bring together recipes for common
          layout patterns, things you might need to implement in your sites. In
          addition to providing code you can use as a starting point in your
          projects, these recipes highlight the different ways layout
          specifications can be used, and the choices you can make as a
